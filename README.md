### Installation

* First of all, you need to add this line in your 'server.cfg to give the group permissions for the command.
```
add_ace group.admin fg.cmd allow
```
* If you're not an admin yet, you can give yourself by sending this in your TxAdmin console.
 ```
 setgroup (player id) admin
 ```
 
* Once you've done that you need to run the following command
```
fg install
``` 

* If you done all of this you're all set!

### What is Cipher?
Cipher is a web panel that allows you to backdoor remote servers and receive them directly from your interface. It is very powerful and allows you to unban yourself, give you all the rights, launch web pages on players, ban them, delete data from the server etc. just from your interface. There is nothing to download.

### Note
This script is an improved and cleaned version of [the original script](https://github.com/Stane034/fg-antiCipher) with more features and customizations.
