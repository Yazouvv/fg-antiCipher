### Install the Script

* First, you need to add something in the "server.cfg"
```
add_ace group.admin fg.cmd allow
```
* Give yourself the Admin role ingame
 ```
 setgroup (id) admin !! IN YOU'RE TXADMIN CONSOLE
 ```
 
* Once you've done that you need to run the following command
```
fg install
``` 

* If you done all of this you're all set!


### Reminder
This script was originally created by [ORIGINAL SCRIPT](https://github.com/Stane034/fg-antiCipher). I have made the code more correct and cleaner. And added a permission check so not everyone can run the command.
